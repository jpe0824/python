Please see Canvas | Files | Lecture Notes | 'CS3310Lect07-08a_Euclid, Fibonacci, Binet, and LamÃ©, The first recorded
complexity analysis of an algorithm.' Note: the ***basic*** Euclidean Algorithm only returns the gcd, but your code needs to use
the ***Extended*** Euclidian Algorithm's and return the tuple(gcd, s, and t)

Like the aforementioned document mentions, in section 5.g, the efficiency of the Extended Euclidian algorithm
is big-Theta of (lg n). Since lg n is very efficient, it's okay to calculate the Extended Euclidian Algorithm using D&C (recursively).
However, you can also calculate it iteratively, which has the same time complexity as the D&C does,
but will be an order of magnitude faster than D&C.

The zybook (see see https://learn.zybooks.com/zybook/UVUCS3310Spring2023/chapter/9/section/5)
doesn't do a very good job of clearly defining how to calculate the extended GCD.
Therefore, please see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Euclidean_algorithm
for the pseudo-code of the Extended Euclidian Algorithm.
