b. In order to decouple the application from the database, we could use the Adapter pattern.
It would allow us to abstract the details of how data is accessed from the database.
- We would start with an interface with methods like addEmp, getEmp, updateEmp, and deleteEmp.
- Then we implement an adapter class to implement the interface and use the database API to perform the operations.
- Finally we use the adapter class in our application to perform the operations.
